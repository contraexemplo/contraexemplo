<img align="left" alt="A parody of the This is fine cartoon. In the original cartoon, a dog drinks coffee by a table while the whole room is on fire. It says This is fine, as if it's ignoring the chaos around it. In this version, the room is full of plants. The cup of coffee was replaced with a small pot with a plant." src="https://github.com/contraexemplo/contraexemplo/blob/04e678310ae306bb2d21339f5951f4e312861f15/this-is-fine-but-with-plants.jpg" width="350"/>
